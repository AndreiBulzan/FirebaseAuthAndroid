# StriveAndroid

An application that helps you manage your invoices. You can choose pictures of invoices from your phone, and automatically detect and extract important information from them. The extracted information will be in text format, thus allowing a 3rd party accounting program to easily add the invoice to the company's documents.
You can choose to upload this information to your account's database, which you can then easily access from any computer through our web application at https://fir-authandroid-32f45.web.app/, or by using this Android application.
